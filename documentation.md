# Train Game Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the JavaScript code for a train game implemented on an HTML canvas. It's designed as a learning resource for those interested in building their own pathfinding games.

## Core Components

### Canvas Setup
The game uses an HTML canvas element with ID 'gameCanvas'. The canvas context is obtained using `getContext('2d')`, which provides methods for drawing on the canvas.

### Grid Configuration
- `gridSize`: Defines the number of cells in the grid (20x20).
- `cellSize`: Defines the size of each cell in pixels (40x40).

These variables determine the overall size and resolution of the game grid.

### Data Structures
- `grid`: A 2D array representing the game grid. Each cell is an object containing:
  - `connections`: An object with boolean values for top, right, bottom, and left connections.
  - `hasTrack`: A boolean indicating if the cell has a track.
- `trainPath`: A 2D array tracking the train's path, used for visualization.

These structures efficiently store the state of the game board and the train's movement.

### Game State Variables
- `highlightedCell`: Tracks the currently highlighted cell for user interaction.
- `trainPosition`: Current position of the train on the grid.
- `trainDirection`: Current direction of the train (using the `directions` enum).
- `isTrainMoving`: Boolean indicating if the train is in motion.
- `trainInterval`: Interval for train movement, used for animation control.
- `trainStart`: Starting position of the train.
- `trainDestination`: Destination position of the train.

These variables manage the dynamic state of the game.

## Detailed Function Explanations

### Drawing Functions

#### `drawGrid()`
This function is responsible for rendering the entire game state on the canvas.

1. It clears the entire canvas using `clearRect()`.
2. Iterates through each cell in the grid:
   - Highlights the current cell if it matches `highlightedCell`.
   - Draws cell borders.
3. Calls helper functions to draw additional elements:
   - `drawTrainPath()`: Visualizes the train's path.
   - `drawTracks()`: Renders the tracks.
   - `drawStartAndDestination()`: Highlights start and end points.
   - `drawTrain()`: Draws the train if it's moving.
   - `drawPositionDisplay()`: Shows the train's current position.

This function is crucial for updating the visual state of the game after any changes.

#### `drawTrain()`
Draws the train as a red rectangle at its current position.

1. Calculates the pixel coordinates based on `trainPosition`.
2. Uses `fillRect()` to draw a smaller rectangle within the cell, representing the train.

#### `drawTracks()`
Renders the tracks on the grid based on cell connections.

1. Iterates through each cell in the grid.
2. For cells with tracks (`hasTrack` is true):
   - Sets up the drawing style (black, 4px wide lines).
   - Draws line segments based on the cell's connections (top, right, bottom, left).

This function visualizes the network of tracks that the train can follow.

#### `drawTrainPath()`
Visualizes the path taken by the train.

1. Sets a semi-transparent green fill color.
2. Iterates through the `trainPath` array.
3. Fills cells where the train has passed with the green color.

This helps players visualize the train's movement history.

#### `drawStartAndDestination()`
Highlights the start and destination cells.

1. If `trainStart` is set, fills that cell with yellow.
2. If `trainDestination` is set, fills that cell with green.

This visually indicates the train's journey endpoints.

#### `drawPositionDisplay()`
Creates a small information panel showing the train's current position.

1. Draws a light gray rectangle for the display background.
2. Adds a border to the display area.
3. Renders text showing the train's current row and column.

This provides real-time feedback on the train's location.

### Game Logic Functions

#### `startTrain()`
Initiates the train's movement from start to destination.

1. Checks if the train can start moving (not already moving, start and destination set).
2. Resets the `trainPath` array.
3. Calls `findPath()` to calculate the route.
4. If a valid path is found:
   - Sets the train's initial position.
   - Starts an interval that moves the train along the path, updating `trainPosition` and redrawing the grid at each step.
5. If no path is found or start/destination aren't set, logs an error message.

This function orchestrates the main game action of moving the train.

#### `stopTrain()`
Halts the train's movement.

1. Checks if the train is moving.
2. If so, sets `isTrainMoving` to false and clears the movement interval.

This allows for manual interruption of the train's journey.

#### `findPath(start, end)`
Implements a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find a path from start to destination.

1. Initializes a queue with the starting position.
2. Uses a Set to keep track of visited cells.
3. While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeues the next path to explore.
   - If the last cell in this path is the destination, returns the path.
   - Otherwise, gets valid neighbors of the last cell.
   - Adds new paths with these neighbors to the queue.
4. If no path is found, returns null.

This function is the core pathfinding logic, ensuring the train can navigate the track network.

#### `getValidNeighbors(row, col)`
Returns an array of valid neighboring cells for a given position.

1. Checks the cell's connections (top, right, bottom, left).
2. For each valid connection, adds the corresponding neighbor to the array.
3. Ensures neighbors are within grid bounds.

This helper function is crucial for the pathfinding algorithm, determining possible moves.

#### `addTrack(row, col)`
Adds a track to the specified cell and updates connections.

1. Checks if the cell is within grid bounds.
2. Sets `hasTrack` to true for the cell.
3. Calls `updateConnections()` to link with adjacent tracks.
4. Redraws the grid and tracks.

This function allows for dynamic track construction by the player.

#### `updateConnections(row, col)`
Updates connections with adjacent cells when adding a track.

1. Checks neighboring cells in all four directions.
2. If a neighbor has a track, establishes a bidirectional connection.

This ensures that newly placed tracks properly connect to the existing network.

#### `generateComplexTrack()`
Generates a random complex track on the grid.

1. Clears the existing grid.
2. Starts from a random position.
3. Repeatedly:
   - Adds a track at the current position.
   - Finds possible moves (up, down, left, right).
   - Chooses a random valid move and updates the position.
4. Continues until reaching a maximum track length or no more moves are possible.
5. Sets the final position as the destination.

This function creates interesting, randomized track layouts for varied gameplay.

### Event Handlers

- Canvas click event: Toggles track placement at the clicked cell.
- Canvas mousemove event: Updates the highlighted cell as the mouse moves.
- Keydown event:
  - 'S' key: Sets the train's start position to the highlighted cell.
  - 'E' key: Sets the train's end position to the highlighted cell.
- 'startButton' click: Calls `startTrain()` to begin the train's journey.
- 'stopButton' click: Calls `stopTrain()` to halt the train.
- 'randomTrackButton' click: Calls `generateComplexTrack()` to create a new random track layout.

These event handlers create an interactive experience, allowing users to build tracks, set start/end points, and control the train.

## Initialization

The script initializes by:
1. Setting up the canvas size to accommodate the grid and information display.
2. Calling `drawGrid()` to render the initial game state.

This ensures the game is ready for interaction as soon as the page loads.
